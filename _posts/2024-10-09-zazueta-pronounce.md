For many of my fellow Zazuetas, this article is not necessary. However, I think it's fair to say that we have all had this conversation at some point in our life:

"Za-zwee-tuh? Am I saying that right?"

If you're trying to be polite(or, you're tired of retreading conversations), you say that it was a close enough pronunciation and move on. And if you ever need to give your name over the phone, you know you have to spell it out every time: Z-A-Z-U-E-T-A.

### Okay, guy. Now how am I actually supposed to say it?
Well, it depends. But let's keep it simple and start with the English pronunciation:

Let's sound it out, together.
ZA(rhymes with "law")
ZWE(rhymes with....."le"? I think?)
tuh(rhymes with "uh")

### Hey doesn't that kinda sound like-
*Shhhhhhhh.*

In high school, when I first corrected people, my friends noticed something that I could never unhear.

"Zazueta", kinda sounds like "The Sweater". If you said it in a corny German accent, of course.

Not going to lie, it annoyed me for a bit before it became an inside joke. I hope I made the right decision to make that public knowledge.....

### Got it. What about the Spanish pronunciation?
I'm glad you asked! In Spanish, you would say:

**SA-SWE-tah**

Sounding it out, that last part, "tah", should rhyme with "law".

It's pretty close, but I won't fault you if you default to the English pronunciation. Either way, you'll be doing a whole lot better than most of my grade school teachers.
