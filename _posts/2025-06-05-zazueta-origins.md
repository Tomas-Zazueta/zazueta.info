OR: The linguistic evolution of the word Zazueta

I have researched this as well as I can; Zazueta is still an obscure surname. Here's all of the info I have gathered so far, I will try to explain everything as well as I can.

Let's start at the beginning.

### Part One: What is in a surname?
Humans have been around for a long time. We had our start in Africa, spreading to the rest of the world thousands of years ago. Until we gained stability in the form of agriculture and rudimentary technology, we didn't write anything down until roughly 3500 BC.

We didn't always need surnames. Usually, your first(given) name would be enough, most settlements were small enough that first names didn't repeat so often. It wasn't until we began living in bigger towns and cities that we needed another way to differentiate all of the James's and Jane's from one another.

The easiest way to keep track of who was who was to derive a second name. This practice continues today in the form of a surname, or last name. 

Surnames have many origins. Some would denote a person's occupation(Sheperd, Smith, Baker). Some would be for a location that someone lived close to(Wood, Chuch, Ford). Other surnames would indicate a familial relationship(Johnson, Fitzroy, MacDonald).

**Zazueta** is named after a place. But I'm getting ahead of myself.

### Part Two: Basque Country
Located in the northern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, the Basque Country, or **Euskal Herria**, is used as the background image of this site!

But there is more to a place than its geographical location, and the Basque Country is no exception. Basque is not only a place, but a culture and language.

The people who first settled this land are shrouded in obscurity. Some archaeologists believe that the original Basque people are remnants of the first Paleolithic inhabitants of Western Europe. The Basque language is unrelated to any other European languages, and is considered a language isolate.

Today, the Basque people have a distinct culture that is separate from Spain and France(the Basque Country crosses over the border between the two countries). Basque independence is a growing movement in the region.

### Part Three: A Place of Blackberries
I derive the information in this section from [Buber's Basque Page](https://www.buber.net/Basque/Surname/Z/zazueta.php). Please check it out!

It appears that the literal translation for Zazueta is "place of blackberries". So based on my quick lesson in surnames, it could mean that we shared an ancestor that lived in a place that had a lot of blackberry bushes, or perhaps a blackberry farm.

What I also find interesting is how Zazueta may have been originally spelled! **Sasoeta** - Imagine a world where we didn't need to sit in the back of class!

Buber notes that Sasoeta specifically comes from **Lasarte**. Whether this is an older version of Zazueta/Sasoreta or a place name, I am pleased to tell you that [it is definitely a place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasarte-Oria):

Anybody want to plan a trip? I still need to find a place that teaches Basque.

### Conclusion
What is in a name? What started as a simple way to keep track of families has turned into a way of looking at ourselves and how far we have come in the 21st century. Hopefully we can find out more about Zazueta's origins, either with some previously-unknown documentation or DNA analysis. 

If you find the next breakthrough, be sure to let us know!
