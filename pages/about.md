Hi! I am a programmer guy, just looking to better my community and the world around us.

I went to HS at Don Bosco Tech, where I first learned to code. 

I went to college at UC Irvine, graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.

I have over 5 years of experience in the tech field, focusing on Data Management & Analysis. I am currently working for the [UC Irvine Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders](https://mind.uci.edu/).

Most importantly, I am part of a very exclusive club - people with **Zazueta** surnames.

Thanks for visting my site! I hope you enjoyed it.
